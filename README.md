# Intro
Instead of using create-react-app for generating the project, I used "vite". Reason for this is because create-react-app is considered deprecated, and "vite" is the new preffered method.

## How to start
In command line type: npm run dev & you are ready to go!
** You do not need to have "vite" installed, it installs in the background. **
