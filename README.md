# Intro

Instead of using create-react-app for generating the project, I used "vite". Reason for this is because create-react-app is considered deprecated, and "vite" is the new preffered method.

## How to start

In command line type: npm run dev & you are ready to go!
** You do not need to have "vite" installed, it installs in the background. **

## CSS Preprocessor SASS

In this project I will be using SASS, the CSS preprocessor.
It must be installed in order to be used.
Installation is done with the following command in the command line: npm i sass

## ClassNames Library

To enable usage of multiple classnames in the project I have used classNames library.
It has to be installed in order to be used.
Installation is done with the following command in the command line: npm i classnames

## Carousel Library

In this project I will be using Carousel Library.
It must be installed in order to be used.
Installation is done with the following command in the command line: npm i react-responsive-carousel

The application is hosted on Netlify via my Github account.

## SVG to SVGR Script

In this project I will be using "convert-icons" script, which converts given svg to svgr (react svg), i.e. it makes a react component out of the given svg, hence the naming svgr.
It must be installed in order to be used.
Installation is done with the following command in the command line: npm i convert-icons

## My feedback and approach to the test

Most of all I liked the design and content. It was clean, clear and concise, tempting enough to cut out all other designs, and start working on this one, although it's labeled as the hardest.
The explanation of the task itself was clear and humorous.

The only thing I missed is being able to download all icons as SVGs (some were both svg and png available, but some weren't).

I have chosen React.js with combination of SCSS to build this project, because these two in combination have given me the flexibility I needed to recreate the given design.
I have managed my time the best I could, so somewhere I've used libraries, to simplify tasks, and somewehere custom style and components, to implement exactly what is needed and asked.

P.S. Regarding the responsive, I didn't have much time left, so I had to improvise and "kill two birds with one stone", so I made only one breakpoint for responsive and used flex-wrap to wrap the potential layout overflows. Also, I didn't have the time to get creative with the responsive design itself, as much as I wanted, so the navbar/hamburger menu turned out pretty much basic, and images components could become much more interesting, but still, it gets the job done.

Overall, the task was challenging and interesting to work on.
